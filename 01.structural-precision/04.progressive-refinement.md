# **Day 4 Workbook: Progressive Refinement Prompting**

### **Concept**

Progressive refinement means you don’t try to get the “perfect” answer in one shot. Instead, you ask for a broad output first, then gradually narrow it down with constraints, improvements, and clarifications.

This mirrors how human brainstorming works: start messy → refine → polish. With Gen AI, this approach yields sharper, more accurate results and saves time.

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Step 1: Broad prompt**

> “Give me 10 startup ideas.”

**AI Output:**

1. An app for pet sitting
2. A meal-prep subscription box
3. A local farmers’ marketplace
4. A drone delivery service
   … up to 10.

**Step 2: Refine with constraints**

> “Filter this list to only ideas that cost under \$500 to start.”

**AI Output:**

1. Pet sitting app (can start as a website or WhatsApp group)
2. Local farmers’ marketplace (just a Facebook group to begin)
3. Meal-prep consulting (low upfront cost)

**Step 3: Further refine with angle**

> “Now pick the most eco-friendly idea and expand it into a 6-month launch plan.”

**AI Output:**
Detailed plan for “local farmers’ marketplace.”

### **Your Turn: Exercises**

**Exercise 1: Broad to Narrow**

1. Ask the AI: *“List 15 blog post ideas about health and wellness.”*
2. Refine: *“Now reduce this to only those that can be written in under 1000 words.”*
3. Refine again: *“Choose the 2 most unique ones and give me outlines.”*

✅ Paste your final outlines below:

**Exercise 2: Refinement in Style**

1. Prompt: *“Write a 200-word story about a time traveler.”*
2. Refine: *“Shorten it to exactly 100 words.”*
3. Refine: *“Rewrite in the style of a bedtime story for kids.”*

✅ Compare the 3 versions. Which one surprised you most?

**Exercise 3: Domain Application**
Think of a real problem in your field (business, art, coding, research).

1. Start broad: Ask AI for 10 possible solutions.
2. Refine: Apply a key constraint (budget, timeline, skill).
3. Refine again: Expand one solution into a detailed plan.

✅ Document your final refined plan here:

### **Reflection Questions**

1. Did refinement give you results you wouldn’t have gotten in a single prompt?
2. How did constraints affect the creativity of outputs?
3. In your work, when would you use broad-to-narrow prompting vs. direct precision?

👉 By the end of today, you’ll have practiced **turning vague AI answers into sharp, usable outputs** through iteration.
