# **Day 5 Workbook — Creativity with Boundaries**

### **Concept**

AI often generates endlessly broad or unfocused ideas when asked to “be creative.” Boundaries and constraints sharpen its imagination. By asking the model to *stay inside a box* — word limits, style restrictions, topic bans, unusual constraints — we paradoxically unlock *more originality*. This works because limitations force the AI (and the human using it) to think in novel directions.

### **Example Prompt**

*"Write a four-line poem about the ocean using only one-syllable words."*

**AI Output (sample):**

```
Blue waves roll,  
winds whip cold.  
Fish swim fast,  
tales grow bold.  
```

Notice how the constraint (one-syllable words) makes the output punchy, rhythmic, and more creative than a generic ocean poem.

### **Your Turn (Exercises)**

1. **Single Constraint:**
   Prompt the AI: *“Describe a sunrise using only numbers and colors.”*

2. **Double Constraint:**
   Prompt the AI: *“Explain gravity as if you’re a pirate, in exactly three sentences.”*

3. **Creative Reversal:**
   Prompt the AI: *“Invent a new game that has no winners.”*

### **Reflection**

* Which exercise felt the most surprising in its outcome?
* Did the constraint make the AI’s response more interesting or less useful?
* How might you use constraints in *your* field (e.g., business, education, art)?

### **Stretch Challenge**

Ask the AI to *summarize your day so far using only movie titles*.
