# **Day 1 – Role-Based Prompting**

### **Concept**

One of the most powerful ways to get high-quality responses from Gen AI is to assign it a role or identity. Instead of asking, *“Explain quantum mechanics,”* you tell the AI, *“You are a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Explain quantum mechanics to a 12-year-old.”*

This frames the AI’s perspective, tone, and level of detail, leading to more precise, useful, and engaging outputs.

### **Example**

**Prompt:**
“You are a stand-up comedian. Explain black holes to a live audience in a funny way.”

**AI Output (sample):**
“Black holes are like the universe’s vacuum cleaners — except instead of dust bunnies, they suck up entire planets. Imagine trying to escape one — it’s like trying to leave an Indian wedding buffet without your aunt noticing. Impossible!”

Notice how the *comedian role* makes the explanation playful, informal, and metaphor-driven.

### **Your Turn (Practice)**

1. Choose a **topic you know something about** (e.g., cooking, programming, fitness, history).
2. Pick **two different roles** (e.g., “a military drill sergeant” and “a kindergarten teacher”).
3. Ask the AI to explain the same topic in both roles.

### **Reflection**

* Which role made the explanation more engaging or clearer for you?
* How might you use role-based prompting in your **work** or **projects**?
* If you combine *multiple roles* (e.g., “a lawyer who explains like a poet”), what could happen?
