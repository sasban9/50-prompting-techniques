# **Day 2 – Instructional Layering**

### **Concept**

Most people ask AI one big question and hope for a neat answer. Instructional layering means breaking the task into **ordered steps**, guiding the AI to think and respond in a structured way. Instead of saying *“Write me an essay about climate change,”* you layer the instructions, like:

1. List the main causes of climate change.
2. Explain each cause in 2–3 sentences.
3. Suggest 3 practical solutions.

This gives clarity, keeps responses organized, and reduces “AI drift.”

### **Example Prompt**

> “Explain the process of photosynthesis in three steps:
>
> 1. Describe the inputs.
> 2. Describe the transformation process.
> 3. Describe the outputs.”

**AI’s Example Output**

1. Inputs: Carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight.
2. Transformation: Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, converting water and CO₂ into energy-rich molecules.
3. Outputs: Glucose for plant growth and oxygen released into the atmosphere.

Notice how layering ensures clarity and order.

### **Your Turn (Practice)**

Pick one of these scenarios (or make your own) and apply instructional layering:

1. **Email Writing:** Ask AI to write an apology email in 3 steps: (1) Acknowledge mistake, (2) Express apology, (3) Offer solution.
2. **Storytelling:** Ask AI to create a short fable in 4 parts: (1) Introduce characters, (2) Describe problem, (3) Show conflict, (4) End with moral.
3. **Business Plan:** Ask AI for a startup pitch in 5 steps: (1) Problem, (2) Solution, (3) Market, (4) Revenue model, (5) Closing hook.

Write your own layered prompt below:

```
My layered prompt: _______________________________________

AI’s response: ___________________________________________
```

### **Reflection**

* Did breaking the task into steps give you a cleaner answer than usual?
* Which step was the AI strongest at? Which was weakest?
* How could you layer instructions differently to improve results?

Write a short note:
