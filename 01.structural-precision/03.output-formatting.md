# **Day 3 Workbook: Output Formatting**

### 🎯 Goal of the Day

Learn how to **control the format** of Gen AI’s responses using clear structures like bullet points, tables, JSON, or custom markers. This makes outputs easier to read, reuse, or plug into other workflows.

---

### 🧠 Concept

Gen AI often produces free-form answers. By **specifying the output structure**, you guide it to return data in the exact format you need. This is especially powerful for research, automation, or passing outputs into APIs.

Common structures:

* **Lists** (bullet or numbered)
* **Tables** (rows/columns)
* **JSON/CSV** (structured for machines)
* **Markdown with headings**
* **Custom markers** (`<< >>`, `---`, etc.)

### 📖 Example

**Prompt:**
“Give me a comparison of cats, dogs, and parrots in a table with columns: Animal, Lifespan, Diet, Common Trait.”

**AI Output:**

| Animal | Lifespan  | Diet        | Common Trait           |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Cat    | 12–16 yrs | Carnivorous | Independent, agile     |
| Dog    | 10–13 yrs | Omnivorous  | Loyal, social          |
| Parrot | 40–60 yrs | Herbivorous | Intelligent, talkative |

### ✍️ Your Turn (Exercises)

**1. Basic formatting**
Write a prompt that asks the AI to explain the **pros and cons of remote work** in a **numbered list**.

**2. Table formatting**
Create a table comparing **three social media platforms** (columns: Platform, User Base, Strength, Weakness).

**3. JSON formatting**
Ask AI to output a **book recommendation list** in JSON format with keys: `"title"`, `"author"`, `"genre"`.

### 🔍 Reflection

* Did the AI follow your format exactly, or did it deviate?
* If it deviated, how could you rewrite your prompt to force stricter formatting?
* Which format (list, table, JSON) seems most useful for your own real-world tasks?

---

👉 By the end of today, you should feel confident telling the AI *not just what to say, but how to present it*.
