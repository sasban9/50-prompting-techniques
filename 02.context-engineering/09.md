Great choice ‚Äî **Day 9: Context Reduction** is one of the most powerful techniques for working with Gen AI when you‚Äôve got **too much text** but need a model to keep the *signal* and discard the *noise*. Let‚Äôs expand this day into a full workbook-style lesson:

# **Day 9 ‚Äì Context Reduction Prompting**

### **Concept**

Most Gen AI models have a context window (a limit to how much text they can ‚Äúsee‚Äù at once). If you feed in too much, the model either:

* truncates content,
* summarizes poorly, or
* loses track of important details.

**Context reduction prompting** is the art of **compressing large inputs into smaller, more useful prompts** without losing meaning.

Think of it like asking a friend to ‚Äújust give me the gist,‚Äù but with **rules about what must be preserved.**

### **Techniques**

1. **Tiered Summaries** ‚Äì Ask for a long ‚Üí medium ‚Üí short version.
2. **Prioritized Reduction** ‚Äì Tell the AI which parts are non-negotiable.
3. **Structured Compression** ‚Äì Preserve key data in a table or bullet form.
4. **Constraint-based Summarization** ‚Äì Force the AI to fit within X words, sentences, or tokens.
5. **Selective Highlighting** ‚Äì Ask the AI to ignore fluff and keep only direct facts or numbers.

### **Example Prompt 1 ‚Äì Tiered Summaries**

Input: *A 2000-word article on climate policy.*
Prompt:
\*"Summarize this article in three versions:

1. A 200-word executive summary,
2. A 50-word abstract,
3. A 1-sentence tweet."\*

Output shows you three compression levels ‚Äî you choose which fits your next task.

---

### **Example Prompt 2 ‚Äì Prioritized Reduction**

\*"Summarize the following meeting transcript, but DO NOT lose:

* Decisions made
* Assigned tasks
* Deadlines
  Everything else can be ignored."\*

This reduces filler dialogue while keeping actionable insights.

---

### **Example Prompt 3 ‚Äì Structured Compression**

*"Summarize this text into a 3-column table: \[Main Point] | \[Supporting Evidence] | \[Implication]."*

Even long documents shrink into a digestible cheat sheet.

---

### **Your Turn (Exercise)**

Take a 500‚Äì1000 word blog post, company report, or even one of your own essays.

1. First, ask AI for a freeform summary in 3 sentences.
2. Then, ask it to shrink the same text into exactly **15 words**.
3. Finally, ask it to give you a **bullet list of 5 takeaways with numbers preserved**.

Notice how each reduction changes what survives ‚Äî that‚Äôs the art of designing the reduction rules.

---

### **Reflection**

* Did the AI lose important nuance at smaller compression levels?
* Which style of reduction (tiered, prioritized, structured) worked best for your needs?
* Could you combine them ‚Äî e.g., *tiered summary first, then structured extraction*?

üëâ By mastering context reduction, you essentially learn how to **‚Äúdistill knowledge like a chemist‚Äù** ‚Äî boiling down vast content into usable prompts that fit inside the model‚Äôs brain without breaking it.
