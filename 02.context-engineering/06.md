# **Day 6: Embedding Context in Prompts**

### **Concept**

Most people give AI vague instructions like “Write me a cover letter” or “Summarize this article.” That leads to generic results. The secret to unlocking sharp, tailored responses is **embedding context directly inside the prompt**.

Context can be:

* **Facts** (your background, data, references)
* **Constraints** (word limits, tone, audience)
* **Scenario setup** (situation, goals, characters)

Think of it like feeding the AI *all the ingredients* before asking it to cook. Without them, it just guesses. With them, it becomes precise and relevant.

### **Technique**

When embedding context, follow this structure:

1. **Set the scene** – Who/what/why.
2. **Insert key facts** – The must-include information.
3. **Give the instruction** – What you want done.
4. **Define the output format** – How you want it delivered.

### **Example 1: Cover Letter**

❌ Weak prompt:
“Write me a cover letter for a job.”

✅ Context-embedded prompt:
“You are a professional career coach. Write me a cover letter for the position of Data Analyst at Google.
Here are key facts about me:

* Recently graduated in Computer Science with top honors.
* Interned at Deloitte working on financial data analysis.
* Strong skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau.
  Make it one page, professional yet approachable, and end with a confident closing line.”

Notice how the second version is **self-contained**. The AI doesn’t need to guess — it has your data, role, and style in one place.

### **Example 2: Creative Writing**

❌ Weak prompt:
“Write a sci-fi story.”

✅ Context-embedded prompt:
“Write a 500-word sci-fi short story.
Context: Humanity has colonized Mars, but water is running out. A teenage engineer discovers a way to extract water from the soil.
Style: Fast-paced, suspenseful, with a hopeful ending.
Audience: Young adult readers.”

### **Mini Exercises**

1. Write down **5 key facts about yourself** (education, hobbies, skills, goals, etc.). Use them in a prompt: “Write a tweet-sized bio for me using these facts.”
2. Take a short article or blog post. Embed the **title, author, and date** into your prompt: “Summarize this 2019 article by John Smith on climate change in exactly 5 bullet points.”
3. Create a **fictional product** (e.g., a smart pillow). Embed product details in the prompt: “Write a sales pitch for the SmartPillow. Context: tracks sleep patterns, auto-adjusts firmness, connects to an app. Tone: witty and playful.”

### **Reflection Questions**

* Did you notice how much sharper the outputs became once you embedded details?
* What kind of context makes the *biggest* difference in your use case (facts, style, audience, or scenario)?
* How can you build a **context checklist** for your most common prompts?
