Alright, let’s expand **Day 8: Prompt Recaps** into a full, workbook-style lesson. This one is subtle but extremely powerful, because it deals with **maintaining continuity** in conversations with GenAI, especially when context is long or complex.

# **Day 8: Prompt Recaps**

### **Concept**

Large language models don’t have permanent memory. They only “see” what you provide in the conversation window. Over time, as the conversation grows, they may lose track of earlier details or drift off-topic.

**Prompt recaps** are a way to anchor the AI back into the flow. By summarizing past exchanges or explicitly telling the model “so far, here’s what we have done,” you create continuity and consistency.

This is essential in projects that stretch across multiple steps — like writing a novel chapter by chapter, running business planning sessions, or conducting research discussions.

### **Why It Works**

* **Context consolidation:** A short recap reminds the AI of key points without overwhelming it with raw text.
* **Focus reset:** Tells the AI “these are the important bits, ignore the noise.”
* **Continuity anchor:** Ensures tone, style, and facts remain consistent across outputs.

### **Prompt Pattern**

```
Here’s what we’ve done so far:  
1. [Summary point 1]  
2. [Summary point 2]  
3. [Summary point 3]  

Based on this, please continue with [next task].
```

### **Example**

**Conversation without recap**
You: “Help me write a detective story in Victorian London.”
AI: \[Writes intro scene.]
You: “Continue the story.”
AI: \[Forgets it’s Victorian, sets scene in modern London.]

**Conversation with recap**
You:

```
So far, we have:  
1. A detective named Inspector Graves.  
2. The setting is foggy Victorian London.  
3. A nobleman has been found murdered in an opera house.  

Continue the story by writing the next 2 paragraphs, keeping style consistent.
```

AI: \[Writes continuation that respects time, place, and tone.]

### **Mini Exercises**

1. **Personal recap**: Start a story about a time traveler in Ancient Egypt. After 2 responses, write your own recap in 3 bullet points and then ask the AI to continue. Compare the continuity with and without a recap.

2. **Fact-heavy recap**: Pretend you’re building a startup idea with AI. After brainstorming 10 ideas, recap the top 3 in your own words, then ask AI to expand only those. Notice how it avoids drifting back into irrelevant options.

3. **Tone recap**: Ask AI to write a poem in the style of Rumi. Then recap: “So far, the poem is mystical, metaphor-rich, spiritual, and free-verse. Continue with another stanza in this same style.” Compare output to when you don’t remind it.

---

### **Reflection Questions**

* Did the recap make the AI stay more consistent?
* Was your recap too detailed (overloading) or too short (missing context)?
* How might you use prompt recaps in your own work (storytelling, research, coding, business strategy)?

### **Pro Tip**

Don’t just recap facts — recap **tone, style, and rules**. If you want consistency, say:

> “So far, we’re keeping a humorous tone, limiting explanations to under 100 words, and focusing on beginner-friendly language. Continue with the same rules.”

That way, the AI doesn’t just remember the *what*, it remembers the *how*.
