### **Day 26: Curriculum-Style Prompting**

**Objective:** Learn how to instruct Gen AI to design structured, step-by-step learning plans, courses, or training modules. By the end of the day, you should be able to generate complete lesson plans for any subject, tailored to your audience and learning objectives.

---

#### **Concept:**

Curriculum-style prompting is about **asking the AI to think like a teacher or course designer**. Instead of just giving information, you guide the AI to **organize knowledge sequentially, scaffold learning, and create assessments**. This transforms AI from a simple answer machine into a **learning architect**.

Key principles:

1. **Define the target audience:** Beginner, intermediate, expert.
2. **Set learning objectives:** What should a learner know or be able to do?
3. **Specify format:** Video, text, exercises, quizzes.
4. **Sequence lessons:** Build from foundational knowledge to advanced skills.
5. **Include assessments:** Reinforce learning with questions, projects, or exercises.

#### **Prompt Structure Examples:**

**Basic Prompt:**
*"Design a 5-day beginner course on Python programming for someone who has never coded. Include learning objectives, key topics, and exercises for each day."*

**Advanced Prompt (Curriculum-style + output formatting):**
*"Act as an expert course designer. Create a 5-day beginner Python programming course. For each day, provide:

1. Title of the lesson
2. Learning objectives
3. Key topics
4. Example exercises
5. Recommended resources
   Format the output in a table or numbered list."*

**Multi-layered Prompt:**
*"Create a curriculum for a 5-day beginner Python course. After generating the first draft, provide a refined version that includes:

* Daily quizzes with 3 questions
* Practical mini-projects for each day
* Estimated time per lesson and exercise
* Notes for educators on common pitfalls learners may face."*

#### **Exercise (Hands-on):**

1. Pick a topic you want to teach (e.g., “AI for business professionals” or “Creative writing for teens”).
2. Ask AI to design a **5-day curriculum**, including:

   * Learning objectives
   * Daily lesson titles
   * Exercises or activities
   * Optional resources
3. Review AI’s output. Identify one day where you think the lesson could be stronger, and ask the AI to **revise it**.
4. Optional: Ask AI to **generate a quiz or challenge** based on one of the lessons.

---

#### **Reflection Questions:**

* Did AI organize the lessons logically from simple to complex?
* Are the exercises actionable and engaging?
* How could you customize the curriculum further for your specific audience?
* Can you identify any gaps that the AI might have missed?

---

#### **Advanced Tip:**

Once you master this, you can **layer techniques from other days**:

* **Role-based prompting:** Ask AI to act as a university professor, or an experienced coach.
* **Multi-perspective prompts:** Include different teaching styles in the curriculum (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).
* **Constraint-driven prompts:** Limit lessons to 30 minutes each or require only free/open-source tools.
