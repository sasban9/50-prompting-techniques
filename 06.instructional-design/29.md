## **Day 29: Socratic Questioning**

### **Objective**

Teach the AI to act as a **Socratic tutor**, prompting the user (or itself) with questions rather than giving direct answers. This helps learners or AI users explore assumptions, reasoning paths, and underlying logic, improving depth, creativity, and problem-solving.

### **Theory / Explanation**

Socratic questioning is a method where knowledge is revealed through guided questions rather than direct answers. When applied to AI prompting:

* Instead of saying, “Here’s the answer,” the AI asks questions like:

  * “Why do you think that is?”
  * “What evidence supports your assumption?”
  * “Can you think of an alternative perspective?”

* This forces the user (or AI) to examine reasoning step by step.

* In Gen AI, it encourages richer outputs and exploration of nuanced ideas.

**Key Principles for Prompting AI Socratically:**

1. **Open-ended prompts**: Avoid yes/no questions; ask “how” or “why.”
2. **Guiding, not telling**: Encourage discovery rather than providing solutions.
3. **Stepwise logic**: Ask questions that build on prior answers.
4. **Challenge assumptions**: Make AI question initial statements or ideas.
5. **Recursive exploration**: Ask follow-up questions until reasoning is fully developed.

### **Prompt Templates**

1. **Basic Socratic Prompt:**

```
You are a Socratic tutor. I will give you a topic, and instead of providing answers, ask me questions that guide me to explore it deeply. Topic: [insert topic here]
```

2. **Stepwise Exploration:**

```
Act as a Socratic AI. For each statement I make, ask me 2-3 probing questions that challenge assumptions or expand reasoning. Start with this statement: "[insert statement]"
```

3. **Recursive Questioning:**

```
I want you to question every answer I give. After each answer, provide 2 new questions that push my reasoning further. Topic: [insert topic]
```

### **Examples**

**Example 1 – Ethics Debate**
**User Prompt:**
“I think AI should replace most jobs to increase efficiency.”

**Socratic AI Response:**

* Why do you believe efficiency should be prioritized over human employment?
* What might be some unintended consequences of replacing most jobs with AI?
* Are there scenarios where AI replacement could cause more harm than good?

**Example 2 – Business Idea**
**User Prompt:**
“I want to start a subscription-based fitness app.”

**Socratic AI Response:**

* Who is your ideal customer, and why would they pay for this service?
* How does your app differ from existing fitness apps?
* What assumptions are you making about customer behavior or preferences?

### **Mini Exercise (Hands-On)**

1. Pick any **topic, statement, or idea**.
2. Use the Socratic prompt template to ask AI questions instead of answers.
3. Answer each AI question yourself.
4. Feed your answer back into AI for further questioning.
5. Repeat 3–5 cycles to explore the topic deeply.

**Example Exercise:**

* Topic: “Remote work improves productivity.”
* Cycle 1: AI asks: “How do you define productivity in this context?”
* User answers: “Output per hour.”
* Cycle 2: AI asks: “Are there factors besides hours worked that affect output?”
* …repeat until the reasoning is fully mapped.

### **Reflection Prompts**

* Which questions pushed you to rethink assumptions?
* Did AI uncover gaps in your reasoning you hadn’t noticed?
* How might you use this method to generate new ideas or solutions in your work?

---

### **Advanced Variation**

* Combine Socratic questioning with **role-playing**: AI becomes a “devil’s advocate” Socratic tutor, challenging your ideas aggressively.
* Add constraints: limit each AI question to **one sentence** to focus thinking.
