### **Day 30: Self-Testing Loops**

**Goal:** Teach AI to evaluate, verify, and improve its own outputs automatically, turning a single prompt into a mini “quality assurance” workflow. This helps reduce errors, improve clarity, and generate higher-quality results without human intervention.

#### **Concept**

A self-testing loop is a method where your prompt includes instructions for the AI to:

1. Generate an output.
2. Check the output for errors, inconsistencies, or missing information.
3. Revise itself and produce a corrected or improved version.

Instead of manually reviewing and prompting multiple times, the AI internally iterates on its own answer.

Key principles:

* Explicitly tell the AI to **verify** its work.
* Ask it to **explain its reasoning** before finalizing.
* Use constraints like word count, style, or factual accuracy in the review step.

#### **Step-by-Step Example**

**Prompt:**

> “Write a 5-bullet summary of the book *1984* by George Orwell. After generating, check each bullet for factual accuracy. If you find errors or missing details, rewrite the bullet points. Finally, output the corrected 5-bullet summary in JSON format with keys ‘bullet1’ to ‘bullet5’.”

**Breakdown:**

1. AI generates first draft of bullet points.
2. AI reads each bullet point and “checks itself”:

   * Are all facts correct?
   * Is any key idea missing?
3. AI produces a corrected output automatically.
4. Output is structured for easy use (JSON in this case).

**Result:**
You get a single prompt that produces **high-quality, verified, and structured output**.

#### **Mini Exercises**

1. **Fact-checking:**

   * Ask AI to summarize an article from a fake news URL.
   * Include a self-test step: “Check if any statements are false or exaggerated, then correct them.”

2. **Creative editing:**

   * Prompt AI to write a short poem in iambic pentameter.
   * Include a self-test: “Check for meter consistency and correct it if necessary.”

3. **Code verification:**

   * Ask AI to write a Python function.
   * Add: “Test this code with an example and correct any errors.”

#### **Pro Tip**

For maximum effectiveness, include a **“reflection” step**: ask AI to explain why it made corrections. This doubles as a learning tool and helps identify **hidden assumptions** the AI makes.

**Example extension in the prompt:**

> “After correcting the bullet points, explain in 2–3 sentences why each correction was needed.”

#### **Why Day 30 is Critical**

By mastering self-testing loops, learners can:

* Reduce human back-and-forth with AI.
* Produce outputs that are **more reliable, professional, and polished**.
* Lay the foundation for **automated multi-step workflows** later in the course (like chaining or delegation).
