# **50 Days of Advanced Prompting Techniques for Gen AI**

## **Phase 1: Structural Precision (Days 1–5)**

**Day 1: Role-based prompting** – Give the AI an identity (“You are a Nobel-winning physicist…”).
Exercise: Ask it to explain quantum tunneling as a comedian vs. a scientist.

**Day 2: Instructional layering** – Break down tasks into numbered steps.
Exercise: Ask for a 3-step summary of any news article, then expand step 2 in detail.

**Day 3: Output formatting** – Use markers, tables, or JSON for clean structure.
Exercise: Get the AI to output a product comparison in JSON format.

**Day 4: Progressive refinement** – Start broad, then refine with constraints.
Exercise: First ask for 10 startup ideas, then refine to only those under \$500 capital.

**Day 5: Creativity with boundaries** – Give specific do’s and don’ts.
Exercise: Generate a poem with only one-syllable words.

---

## **Phase 2: Context Engineering (Days 6–10)**

**Day 6: Embedding context** – Put relevant info directly in the prompt.
Exercise: Provide 3 bullet facts about yourself and ask AI to draft a cover letter.

**Day 7: Long-form anchoring** – Use a story or background to shape output.
Exercise: Give a fictional world description, then ask AI to create laws for it.

**Day 8: Prompt recaps** – Summarize past exchanges inside the prompt.
Exercise: After 2 responses, ask AI to recap its own answers before continuing.

**Day 9: Context reduction** – Shrink large inputs without losing meaning.
Exercise: Ask AI to summarize a 1000-word essay into exactly 3 sentences.

**Day 10: Simulated memory** – Build continuity by re-feeding AI’s own outputs.
Exercise: Ask AI to remember a fictional character’s backstory and continue it daily.

---

## **Phase 3: Creativity Amplification (Days 11–15)**

**Day 11: Divergent vs convergent** – Generate many ideas, then narrow down.
Exercise: 20 app ideas → shortlist the 3 most profitable.

**Day 12: Randomization seeding** – Add “pick a random animal” to fuel novelty.
Exercise: Write a business pitch that includes a giraffe.

**Day 13: Hypotheticals** – Frame prompts as “What if…?”
Exercise: What if electricity was never discovered? Describe today’s world.

**Day 14: Multi-perspective** – Ask for multiple viewpoints on one issue.
Exercise: Debate AI ethics as an engineer, a poet, and a lawyer.

**Day 15: Inversion** – Flip assumptions.
Exercise: Instead of “how to succeed at work,” ask “how to fail at work.”

---

## **Phase 4: Persona Engineering (Days 16–20)**

**Day 16: Multi-role simulation** – AI plays multiple characters.
Exercise: Simulate a panel of experts discussing climate change.

**Day 17: Alter-ego prompting** – Create a rebellious counter-voice.
Exercise: AI as “Devil’s Advocate” against your own argument.

**Day 18: Cross-discipline synthesis** – Merge fields.
Exercise: Explain blockchain as if it were a cooking recipe.

**Day 19: Style-mirroring** – Mimic a style (academic, Shakespeare, TikTok).
Exercise: Summarize Newton’s laws in rap lyrics.

**Day 20: Role conflict** – Assign two contradictory roles.
Exercise: Ask AI to argue both for and against remote work simultaneously.

---

## **Phase 5: Chain-of-Thought Mastery (Days 21–25)**

**Day 21: Step reasoning** – Request explicit reasoning.
Exercise: Ask AI to solve a math riddle step by step.

**Day 22: Hidden reasoning** – Ask for final answer only (test conciseness).
Exercise: “Do the reasoning silently, just give me the answer.”

**Day 23: Multi-pass refinement** – Re-run outputs with extra polishing.
Exercise: First draft → improve clarity → shorten.

**Day 24: Reverse-engineering** – Deconstruct an output back to logic.
Exercise: Give AI a conclusion and ask it to infer reasoning.

**Day 25: Branching reasoning** – Generate multiple solution paths.
Exercise: Ask for 3 possible solutions to world hunger, each with pros/cons.

---

## **Phase 6: Instructional Design (Days 26–30)**

**Day 26: Curriculum-style prompts** – Build lessons.
Exercise: Ask AI to create a 5-day crash course on Python.

**Day 27: Progressive challenge** – Increase difficulty step by step.
Exercise: Math questions that get harder each time.

**Day 28: Tutor-student simulation** – Ask AI to quiz you and give feedback.

**Day 29: Socratic questioning** – AI only asks guiding questions.

**Day 30: Self-testing loops** – Ask AI to test its own answer for errors.

---

## **Phase 7: Constraint-Driven Prompting (Days 31–35)**

**Day 31: Word count limits** – Exact number of words.
Exercise: Write a 7-word life lesson.

**Day 32: Tone control** – Friendly vs formal.
Exercise: Same email in 3 tones.

**Day 33: Register shifting** – Street slang vs corporate jargon.

**Day 34: Time-era localization** – As if written in 1800s.

**Day 35: Resource-limited** – Explain using only emojis.

---

## **Phase 8: Multi-Modal Prompting (Days 36–40)**

**Day 36: Image-to-text** – Ask AI to caption an image (if tools allow).

**Day 37: Text-to-visual** – Write prompts for an image generator.

**Day 38: Style blending** – Combine “sci-fi” + “noir detective” storytelling.

**Day 39: Diagram description** – Ask AI to describe a flowchart in text.

**Day 40: Multi-modal layering** – Mix instructions across text + visuals.

---

## **Phase 9: Workflow Engineering (Days 41–45)**

**Day 41: Prompt chaining** – Sequence outputs.

**Day 42: API-ready formatting** – JSON/CSV outputs for code.

**Day 43: Validation loops** – AI checks its own work.

**Day 44: Error correction** – Force AI to find mistakes in past outputs.

**Day 45: Delegation** – AI assigns itself sub-tasks.
