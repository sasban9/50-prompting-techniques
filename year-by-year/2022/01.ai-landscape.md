Great — here’s a **complete instructor-ready script** for **Module 1** of the *2022 Low-Code AI Course*, designed for a **4-hour live, hands-on session**. It’s written so you could literally read it aloud or follow it as a teaching guide, including what to say, how to explain concepts, when to pause for exercises, and what students should build.

# 🧠 Module 1: The AI Landscape in 2022 & No-Code Tools

**Duration:** 4 hours
**Goal:** By the end of this module, students will understand what AI is (and isn’t), how it evolved to the state it was in by 2022, and how to start using low-code tools to build AI workflows — without writing a single line of code.

---

## 🕐 Part 1 – Welcome & Orientation (15 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Welcome, everyone. Today marks the start of your journey into the world of low-code AI — and we’re beginning exactly where the industry was in 2022. Before ChatGPT exploded into the public consciousness, before image generation took over the creative world, AI was already quietly transforming businesses through automation, prediction, and data-driven decision-making.

Our mission in this course is simple: to make you *AI capable* — not by teaching you to write complex code, but by showing you how to **think like an AI builder** and assemble powerful applications using the tools that were available in 2022.”

## 🧭 Part 2 – What Is AI? (45 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Let’s start with the basics. The term *Artificial Intelligence* is often thrown around casually — but what does it actually mean? At its core, AI is about building systems that can perform tasks which, if a human did them, we’d call them intelligent.

These tasks usually fall into a few categories:

* Understanding language
* Recognizing patterns
* Making predictions
* Making decisions
* Perceiving the world (like vision or sound)

But here’s the key distinction: **AI ≠ magic.** AI is not a sentient being, and it doesn’t ‘understand’ the world like we do. It’s a collection of mathematical models trained to recognize patterns from data.”

**[Slide: Types of AI Tasks]**

* Classification (e.g., spam or not spam)
* Prediction (e.g., will this customer churn?)
* NLP (e.g., summarizing a text)
* Computer Vision (e.g., detecting an object in an image)
* Automation (e.g., triggering actions based on data)

**Instructor:**
“Every modern AI system — whether it’s a chatbot, recommendation engine, or fraud detector — is just a combination of these tasks.”

**Short Reflection (5 min):**
Ask: “Think of one app you use daily that involves AI. What task does it perform behind the scenes?”

## 📜 Part 3 – The Evolution of AI Until 2022 (30 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“To understand why 2022 was such an interesting year for low-code AI, we need to understand how we got there.”

**[Timeline Slide – AI Milestones]**

* 1950: Turing Test – AI as a concept
* 1980s: Expert systems – AI in niche domains
* 2000s: Machine learning – AI learns from data
* 2012: Deep learning – major breakthroughs in vision
* 2018: GPT-2 – language models become useful
* 2020: GPT-3 – AI can now generate coherent text
* 2022: Democratization – no-code and API tools explode

**Instructor:**
“By 2022, the core capabilities were strong enough that companies like Microsoft, Google, Hugging Face, and OpenAI started releasing **platforms and APIs** that anyone could plug into — and a new category of tools emerged: *low-code and no-code AI platforms*. These let people who don’t know Python or TensorFlow still build real AI applications.”

## 🛠️ Part 4 – Low-Code AI Tools Overview (30 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Let’s look at some of the major low-code tools that were available in 2022:”

**1. Microsoft Power Automate / Power Apps** – Workflow automation with AI capabilities built in.
**2. Zapier + AI Integrations** – Connect apps and services with pre-trained NLP tasks.
**3. Hugging Face AutoNLP** – Train NLP models from a CSV dataset with no code.
**4. Google Teachable Machine** – Build custom image classifiers through drag-and-drop.
**5. OpenAI Playground (GPT-3)** – Experiment with language models using prompts.

**Instructor:**
“These tools democratized AI. They allowed non-developers — marketers, educators, managers — to integrate intelligence into their workflows.”

## 💻 Part 5 – Hands-On Lab 1: Your First AI Workflow (75 min)

**Goal:** Build a simple sentiment analysis pipeline without writing code.

**Instructor Script:**
“Now we’re going to get our hands dirty. Our task: create a workflow that reads a text input, analyzes the sentiment (positive/negative/neutral), and logs the result into a spreadsheet — all without coding.”

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up:** Create accounts on Zapier (or Power Automate) and Hugging Face.
2. **Model Selection:** On Hugging Face, find a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
3. **Workflow Creation:**

   * Trigger: New Google Form submission.
   * Action 1: Send the text to Hugging Face for analysis.
   * Action 2: Store the sentiment result in a Google Sheet.

**Instructor Commentary:**
“Notice what we just did: we combined three pieces — a trigger, an AI model, and a storage action — into an end-to-end pipeline. And we did it without writing a single line of code. That’s the essence of low-code AI.”

**Q&A (10 min):**
Ask students to brainstorm 3 other problems this same pipeline could solve (e.g., analyzing customer feedback, classifying support tickets, etc.).

## 🤖 Part 6 – Hands-On Lab 2: GPT-3 Playground (45 min)

**Goal:** Explore GPT-3’s capabilities through the Playground.

**Instructor Script:**
“Before ChatGPT, the way most people interacted with OpenAI models was through the Playground. It’s a simple prompt → completion interface. Let’s experiment.”

**Steps:**

1. Open the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).
2. Try prompts like:

   * “Summarize this paragraph in one sentence.”
   * “Write a polite reply to this email.”
   * “List three reasons why a customer might cancel a subscription.”
3. Adjust parameters (temperature, max tokens) and observe changes.

**Instructor Commentary:**
“What’s powerful here is that we’re not *programming* the model — we’re *communicating* with it. This concept, later known as **prompt engineering**, became a crucial skill once models like ChatGPT launched.”

## 📊 Part 7 – Mini Project: AI-Powered Feedback Classifier (30 min)

**Assignment:**
“Create a low-code app that takes feedback from a Google Form, classifies its sentiment using Hugging Face, and sends a follow-up email using Zapier or Power Automate.”

**Guidelines:**

* Input: Feedback text
* Processing: Sentiment classification
* Output: Log result + send thank-you email

**Instructor:**
“This mini project might seem simple — but this is how companies were already automating thousands of tasks in 2022. Most AI in the real world doesn’t look like sci-fi robots — it looks like this: invisible intelligence woven into business workflows.”

---

## 🧩 Part 8 – Wrap-Up & Reflection (15 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Let’s step back and reflect. Today you’ve learned:

* What AI really is and why it matters.
* How AI evolved to its 2022 state.
* How low-code tools allow anyone to use AI without programming.
* How to build an actual AI pipeline from scratch.

This foundation will make everything else in this course much easier. In our next module, we’ll go deeper into **automation**, combining AI with real business logic to solve meaningful problems.”

**Homework (Optional):**

* Sign up for 2 other low-code AI platforms and explore their templates.
* Try building a simple text classifier with your own dataset on AutoNLP.
