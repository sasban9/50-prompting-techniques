Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs go deep into the **2022 version** of the 24-hour hands-on low-code AI course. Think of this year as the **‚Äúfoundations era‚Äù**: generative AI wasn‚Äôt mainstream yet, but the building blocks ‚Äî automation, basic machine learning, simple NLP, and early GPT-3 usage ‚Äî were all in place. Students here learn **what AI could already do without writing code** and how to build useful solutions from those capabilities.

I‚Äôll structure it as **6 modules √ó 4 hours** (total 24 hours), with theory, hands-on labs, and mini-projects for each.

  * OpenAI GPT-3 Playground

**Hands-On (2h):**

* Sign up and set up accounts on 3‚Äì4 tools.
* Explore a pre-built NLP pipeline (e.g., sentiment analysis in Hugging Face).
* Build a simple automation: email ‚Üí sentiment ‚Üí Slack notification.

**Mini Project (1h):**

* **‚ÄúAI Intro App‚Äù**: Make a workflow that analyzes incoming text (email, tweet, or survey) and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral ‚Äî without writing a single line of code.

---

### **Module 2 ‚Äì Automating Tasks with Low-Code AI (4h)**

**Objective:** Learn how AI was used to automate repetitive workflows before generative AI became mainstream.

**Theory (1h):**

* AI vs automation: where they overlap and where they don‚Äôt.
* Use cases: email filtering, lead scoring, ticket routing, notifications.
* Basics of connecting APIs and using AI as part of a workflow.

**Hands-On (2h):**

* Use Power Automate or Zapier to build:

  * A workflow that reads text and classifies it with an AI API.
  * A pipeline that logs results in Google Sheets or Airtable.

**Mini Project (1h):**

* **‚ÄúSmart Inbox Assistant‚Äù**: Automatically label and prioritize support emails based on urgency and tone.

---

### **Module 3 ‚Äì Text Intelligence: Early NLP & GPT-3 (4h)**

**Objective:** Work with text-processing AI tools that existed before ChatGPT‚Äôs boom.

**Theory (1h):**

* What is NLP? Key tasks: classification, entity recognition, summarization.
* Intro to GPT-3 and how it was accessed in 2022 (Playground & API).
* Concept of prompt ‚Üí completion workflows.

**Hands-On (2h):**

* Use Hugging Face AutoNLP to train a sentiment classifier.
* Try GPT-3 Playground to summarize text, rewrite emails, or answer questions.
* Use GPT-3 to build a simple FAQ bot (no-code front-end + API).

**Mini Project (1h):**

* **‚ÄúAI Text Assistant‚Äù**: Create a tool that reads a block of text (like a customer review) and outputs a short summary and sentiment rating.

---

### **Module 4 ‚Äì Vision AI: Classification Without Code (4h)**

**Objective:** Explore how image recognition worked in the pre-Stable Diffusion era ‚Äî focusing on classifiers, OCR, and tagging.

**Theory (1h):**

* Basics of computer vision: image classification vs object detection.
* Common applications: product tagging, quality control, OCR.
* Why pre-trained models were essential in 2022.

**Hands-On (2h):**

* Train a simple image classifier using **Google Teachable Machine**.
* Use **Lobe.ai** to classify product images or handwritten digits.
* Integrate a pre-trained vision model into a workflow (e.g., Google Vision API ‚Üí spreadsheet).

**Mini Project (1h):**

* **‚ÄúSmart Image Sorter‚Äù**: Create a tool that classifies a folder of images into categories (e.g., cats/dogs, damaged/intact) and logs results.

---

### **Module 5 ‚Äì Combining AI + Automation (4h)**

**Objective:** Learn to chain multiple AI components together into a cohesive solution ‚Äî a critical 2022-era skill.

**Theory (1h):**

* Why combining models is more powerful than single tasks.
* Designing AI workflows: input ‚Üí processing ‚Üí output ‚Üí action.
* The ‚Äúglue‚Äù layer: webhooks, APIs, and triggers.

**Hands-On (2h):**

* Build a workflow: email ‚Üí NLP classification ‚Üí auto-reply generation ‚Üí database logging.
* Combine text and image AI: image ‚Üí tag ‚Üí generate caption.

**Mini Project (1h):**

* **‚ÄúAI Content Pipeline‚Äù**: Create a tool that reads a product review, analyzes sentiment, generates a one-line summary, and stores it in a Google Sheet.

---

### **Module 6 ‚Äì Final Project: Build a Real AI App (4h)**

**Objective:** Apply everything learned to design a complete no-code AI product.

**Guidelines (1h):**

* Choose a real-world problem in business, education, or personal productivity.
* Break it into components: input, AI processing, automation, and output.

**Build Time (2h):**

* Example project ideas:

  * Customer feedback analyzer + auto-response system
  * Image categorizer + notification app
  * Resume screening tool + scoring dashboard

**Presentations & Feedback (1h):**

* Students present final projects.
* Discuss limitations of 2022 tools and how future AI could improve them.
