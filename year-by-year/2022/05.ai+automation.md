Here’s a complete **teaching script** for **Module 5 – Combining AI + Automation (4 hours)** of the 2022-version low-code AI course. This script is written as if you were **teaching it live**, with instructor explanations, transitions, exercises, and student prompts — so you can use it almost word-for-word in a class or workshop.

## 🧠 Module 5: Combining AI + Automation

**Duration:** 4 hours
**Theme:** Connecting AI building blocks into real-world workflows
**Learning Goal:** Students learn how to chain multiple AI tools together — text, vision, NLP, and automation — to build an end-to-end solution that does something useful with minimal or no code.

### 🕐 0:00 – 0:20 | Warm-Up and Concept Introduction

**Instructor Script:**

> “Up to this point, we’ve built small AI components — a text classifier here, an image recognizer there, maybe even an automation that routes emails. But in the real world, AI is rarely used in isolation. It’s when we **combine** these components that the real magic happens.”

> “Think about it: Amazon doesn’t just classify a product image. It tags it, writes a description, predicts demand, and updates the inventory — all in one automated chain. Today, we’re going to do exactly that — build an AI *workflow* that strings together multiple steps into something powerful.”

Explain the **basic pipeline model:**

1. **Input** – raw data comes in (email, image, text, file).
2. **AI Processing** – classification, summarization, tagging, extraction.
3. **Automation Trigger** – a decision or action is triggered based on AI output.
4. **Output** – an action is taken (email sent, database updated, Slack message posted).

Draw this as a simple flow on a whiteboard or slide.

### 🕐 0:20 – 0:45 | Real-World Examples of AI Pipelines

**Instructor Script:**

> “Let’s look at some real examples of how AI and automation come together in real products.”

* **Customer Service:** Email → Sentiment Analysis → Auto-prioritization → Ticket assignment.
* **Content Marketing:** Blog text → Summarization → Auto-social post generation → Scheduling.
* **E-commerce:** Product image → Auto-tagging → SEO description → Store listing.

Ask the class:

> “Can anyone think of a workflow they use daily that could be automated with AI?”

(Spend ~5 minutes collecting ideas on a whiteboard — this will help them later in the project phase.)

### 🕐 0:45 – 1:45 | Hands-On Lab 1 – Email Classifier to Slack Notification

**Objective:** Create a 3-step pipeline that reads emails, classifies sentiment, and notifies a team in Slack.

**Step 1 – Set up automation trigger (15 min):**

* Use **Zapier** or **Power Automate**.
* Choose “New Email Received” (e.g., Gmail) as the trigger.

**Instructor Script:**

> “Our pipeline starts with a trigger. Triggers are the ‘event listeners’ of automation — they wait for something to happen, like an email arriving. Once that happens, we pass the content to AI.”

---

**Step 2 – Add NLP processing (20 min):**

* Add a step that calls a pre-built sentiment analysis API (e.g., Hugging Face model endpoint).
* Map email body text → Sentiment classifier.

**Instructor Script:**

> “This is the AI heart of our workflow. Here, we’re not writing code — just passing data to a pre-trained NLP model and getting back a label like *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*.”

---

**Step 3 – Send Slack message (20 min):**

* Add a conditional step: If sentiment = “negative”, post message in #support Slack channel.
* Include original email text + sentiment label.

**Instructor Script:**

> “This is the output phase — an action triggered by the AI’s decision. In this case, we’re escalating negative emails directly to the team so they can respond quickly.”

---

**Checkpoint Discussion (10 min):**
Ask:

* “How many manual steps did we automate?”
* “Where could we add more intelligence?”
* “What other actions could this trigger?”

---

### 🕐 1:45 – 2:00 | Break (15 min)

---

### 🕐 2:00 – 3:00 | Hands-On Lab 2 – Image + Text AI Combined

**Objective:** Build a workflow that tags an image, generates a caption, and stores it in a database.

**Step 1 – Upload Trigger (10 min):**

* Use a cloud storage trigger (e.g., “New image uploaded to Google Drive” or Airtable).

**Step 2 – Image Classification (20 min):**

* Use **Teachable Machine** or **Lobe.ai** model endpoint.
* Get label predictions (e.g., “cat,” “dog,” “car,” “furniture”).

**Instructor Script:**

> “This stage demonstrates combining vision AI with automation. Once a new image is uploaded, our system immediately classifies it — no human intervention.”

---

**Step 3 – Caption Generation (20 min):**

* Send the classification result + image description to GPT-3 Playground via API.
* Prompt example: “Write a short, fun social media caption for a photo of a {label}.”

**Instructor Script:**

> “Now we pass the machine’s understanding to a language model. It turns raw prediction into something meaningful and useful — in this case, a caption.”

---

**Step 4 – Store Result (10 min):**

* Save the label + caption into Airtable or Google Sheets.
* (Optional) Trigger a follow-up workflow to schedule a social post.

---

**Reflection Discussion (10 min):**
Ask:

* “How many different AI components did we use?”
* “What’s the advantage of chaining models like this?”
* “Where could you deploy this kind of workflow in a business?”

---

### 🕐 3:00 – 3:50 | Mini Project – Build Your Own Pipeline

**Objective:** Students design and build their own 3–4-step AI workflow.

* Choose any combination of tools used so far (text, image, automation).
* Examples:

  * Resume screening: Upload → NLP → Scoring → Email.
  * Product review monitor: New review → Sentiment → Summary → Slack.
  * Image-to-website workflow: Upload → Tag → Description → Database.

**Instructor Script:**

> “This is where you turn everything we’ve done into something original. Think about a workflow you’d actually use. Keep it small — three or four steps. The goal isn’t complexity, it’s *end-to-end automation*.”

Walk around and guide teams individually. Ensure they document each step: trigger → AI processing → decision → action.

---

### 🕐 3:50 – 4:00 | Wrap-Up & Discussion

**Instructor Script:**

> “Today you’ve learned one of the most valuable lessons in AI development: a single model is powerful, but a *system* of models and automations is transformative. That’s how real-world AI products work — by linking together small, intelligent components into big, impactful workflows.”

> “Tomorrow, when you see an AI tool doing something impressive, remember: it’s not magic. It’s usually a pipeline — multiple small AIs, automations, and decisions chained together just like the ones you built today.”

* Understand the concept of end-to-end AI pipelines.
* Combine multiple AI models with triggers and actions.
* Automate real workflows with no-code tools.
* Design and deploy a mini AI system that processes, decides, and acts autonomously.
