Absolutely — here’s a **complete teaching script for Module 3 (Text Intelligence: Early NLP & GPT-3)** from your **2022 low-code AI course**. It’s written like a ready-to-teach instructor’s guide for a 4-hour session: including explanations, talking points, demos, transitions, activities, and project instructions.

## 🧠 Module 3: Text Intelligence — Early NLP & GPT-3 (4 Hours)

**Learning Goal:** By the end of this module, students will understand what Natural Language Processing (NLP) is, how early GPT-3 text generation worked before ChatGPT, and how to build useful text-based AI tools without writing code.

---

### 🕐 Hour 1 – Introduction to NLP and Text AI

**Instructor Script:**

“Up until now, we’ve mostly used AI to classify things or automate simple tasks. But most of the world’s information is not numbers or images — it’s *text*. Every email, message, review, support ticket, or document is text. Understanding it, summarizing it, classifying it, or even generating new text — that’s the domain of **Natural Language Processing**, or NLP.”

**Explain Core Concepts (15 min):**

* NLP = branch of AI that deals with understanding, interpreting, and generating human language.
* Common tasks:

  * **Classification:** Is a tweet positive or negative?
  * **Named Entity Recognition:** Find names, dates, places.
  * **Summarization:** Turn long text into a short summary.
  * **Question Answering:** Answer a question based on context.
  * **Text Generation:** Write something new based on a prompt.

“Before 2023’s ChatGPT era, NLP was already powerful — but it wasn’t conversational. It was used in background systems like spam filters, recommendation engines, or document analyzers.”

**Instructor Demo (20 min): Hugging Face AutoNLP**

“Let’s see how we can do this ourselves — without any code.”

1. Go to [Hugging Face AutoNLP](https://huggingface.co/autonlp).
2. Upload a small dataset (we’ll use a CSV of product reviews labeled positive or negative).
3. Train a sentiment analysis model.
4. Test it with a few sentences live.

**Talking Point:** “Notice how we never wrote a single line of code. The model learned to classify sentiment purely from labeled examples. This was a big step toward democratizing NLP.”

---

**Mini Discussion (10 min):**
Ask students:

* “What kinds of text data does your industry use?”
* “Which of these tasks would be most valuable if automated?”

### 🕐 Hour 2 – GPT-3: The Pre-ChatGPT Revolution

**Instructor Script:**

“In 2020, OpenAI launched GPT-3 — the first large-scale general language model that could generate text that felt human. But back in 2022, it was accessed mostly through the **OpenAI Playground** or APIs. You didn’t have chatbots yet — but you *did* have raw text completion.”

**Explain GPT-3 Basics (20 min):**

* Transformer-based LLM trained on vast internet text.
* Works by predicting the next word based on a prompt.
* Not fine-tuned for chat (that comes later), but excellent at:

  * Writing summaries
  * Expanding ideas
  * Rewriting text
  * Generating emails, FAQs, blog outlines

**Live Demo: GPT-3 Playground (20 min)**

1. Go to [platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).
2. Choose the “text-davinci-003” model (most capable in 2022).
3. Try examples:

   * Prompt: “Summarize the following review in one sentence: [paste a paragraph]”
   * Prompt: “Rewrite this email in a more polite tone: [paste email]”
   * Prompt: “List three FAQs for a small bakery website.”

**Teaching Tip:** Show how *slight changes in the prompt* change the result. Emphasize the importance of wording and context.

---

**Guided Student Activity (20 min): “Prompt Playground”**

Students work individually or in pairs. Give them a list of text tasks:

* Summarize a news article in 2 sentences.
* Rephrase a rude email politely.
* Generate a product description from a list of features.
* Extract names and dates from a paragraph.

Have them paste their prompts into the Playground and compare results.

**Debrief (10 min):**

* What surprised you?
* Where was GPT-3 strong or weak?
* How could this be useful in a business context?

---

### 🕐 Hour 3 – Building a No-Code NLP Tool

**Instructor Script:**

“Now that we understand the basics, let’s actually build something useful. Remember: our goal isn’t to train models — it’s to *assemble* existing AI into products.”

**Step-by-Step Build: “AI Text Assistant” (60 min)**

We’ll create a tool that:

1. Takes a block of text (like a customer review).
2. Summarizes it.
3. Classifies its sentiment.
4. Suggests an automated reply.

**Option A – Using No-Code Platform (e.g., Bubble + OpenAI API)**
Walk students through:

* Setting up a simple front-end with an input box and button.
* Connecting to the GPT-3 API (show how to paste API key).
* Designing prompt templates:

  * “Summarize this text: …”
  * “Classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral: …”
  * “Generate a polite 2-sentence reply: …”

**Option B – Pre-built Integrations (Zapier + OpenAI)**
If you prefer fully no-code:

* Use a Google Sheet for input text.
* Zapier calls OpenAI for summarization and sentiment.
* Output stored in a new column.

**Instructor Tips:**

* Keep prompts short and structured.
* Explain that 2022-era GPT-3 was sensitive to phrasing — so “prompt engineering” was a skill.
* Show how to add a character limit or word count constraint.

---

### 🕐 Hour 4 – Mini Project + Reflection

**Mini Project (45 min): “AI Review Analyzer”**

Students create their own simple application based on everything learned:

* Input: customer review text.
* Output:

  1. Summary (1 sentence)
  2. Sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
  3. Suggested automated reply

Encourage them to experiment with different prompts and outputs.

**Project Presentation (15 min):**

* Each student (or group) presents their tool to the class.
* Discuss:

  * Where could this tool be useful in the real world?
  * What limitations did they notice?
  * How might future models (like ChatGPT) change this?

## 🧰 Wrap-Up and Key Takeaways (10 min)

**Instructor Closing Remarks:**

“Today you built tools that understand, summarize, and even write text — all without code. In 2022, this was groundbreaking. Companies were already using GPT-3 for email automation, content generation, and customer support before conversational AI existed. What you’ve built today is the foundation of everything that came later — including ChatGPT itself.”

Key Lessons:

* NLP lets AI understand human language at scale.
* GPT-3 was the first general-purpose language generator, even before chat interfaces.
* Prompt engineering was (and still is) the most important skill in low-code AI projects.
* Combining classification, summarization, and generation unlocks powerful real-world workflows.

✅ **End of Module 3** – Students should now be comfortable building text-based AI tools and understand the pre-ChatGPT landscape of NLP.
