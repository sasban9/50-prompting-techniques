Here’s a complete **facilitator-ready script** for **Module 6 – Final Project: Build a Real AI App** (4 hours) from the 2022 low-code AI course. This script is written so you can **read it aloud, teach directly from it, and guide students step by step**. It’s structured like a live workshop with timings, dialogues, instructions, and teaching cues.

## 🧠 Module 6 – Final Project: Build a Real AI App (4 Hours)

**Title:** “From Idea to Reality: Your First End-to-End AI Solution”
**Objective:** By the end of this session, students will design, build, and present a complete AI-powered product **without writing a single line of code** — combining text, image, and automation components they’ve learned so far.

## 🧭 1. Introduction & Inspiration (30 min)

**Instructor script:**

“Congratulations — you’ve reached the final module of our 2022 low-code AI journey. Over the past five modules, you’ve learned how to work with text, image, and automation. You’ve built chatbots, classifiers, workflows, and pipelines.

Today, we’ll bring all of those skills together to create something *real*: a complete AI product that solves a problem end-to-end. This project is where you stop *learning tools* and start *designing solutions*.”

**[Show Slide: ‘What We’re Building Today’]**

“Your final project will be a working prototype of an AI-powered solution. It should include:

* At least one **AI component** (text or image model)
* At least one **automation layer** (e.g., Zapier, Power Automate, or workflow trigger)
* A **real-world use case** — something someone would actually use
* A **usable output** — a dashboard, email, message, or structured data”

---

**Examples of Good Final Projects (present these as inspiration):**

* **Smart Inbox Assistant:** Reads incoming emails, classifies them by urgency, summarizes key info, and sends a Slack notification.
* **Feedback Analyzer:** Collects customer feedback from Google Sheets, analyzes sentiment, generates one-line summaries, and stores results.
* **Visual Sorter:** Uploads product images, classifies them into categories (e.g., damaged vs. okay), and sends a report email.
* **Resume Screener:** Reads CVs from a folder, extracts keywords, scores them based on a predefined profile, and logs them into Airtable.

“Your project doesn’t need to be huge — it just needs to *work*. Focus on solving a small but meaningful problem.”

## 🧠 2. Project Planning & Architecture (45 min)

**Instructor script:**

“Before you start building, we’ll design the system on paper. A great AI product isn’t about tools — it’s about *flow*. We’re going to plan that flow now.”

**Step 1: Define the Problem (10 min)**
“Write down one sentence describing the problem your solution will solve. For example:

* ‘Our company gets too many support emails — we need a way to classify and respond automatically.’
* ‘We have thousands of product photos and need them labeled by category.’
* ‘We want to summarize long survey responses into short insights.’”

**Prompt students to write their idea and share a few examples.**

---

**Step 2: Break It Into Components (15 min)**
“Next, we design the architecture. Every AI project — even low-code — follows the same 4-step pipeline:

1. **Input:** Where is your data coming from? (Email, upload, form, folder, etc.)
2. **Processing (AI):** What AI task is performed? (Classify, summarize, extract, tag, etc.)
3. **Automation:** What happens after processing? (Store, notify, send, visualize)
4. **Output:** Where does the result go? (Sheet, email, dashboard, Slack, etc.)

Example — *Resume Screener*:

* Input: Uploaded resumes from Dropbox
* Processing: NLP model extracts skills + classifies candidate fit
* Automation: Sends summary to HR Slack channel
* Output: Updates a Google Sheet with scores”

**Activity:** Have students sketch their pipeline on paper or a whiteboard.

---

**Step 3: Choose the Tools (20 min)**
“Now match each pipeline step with a tool you already know.”

Examples:

* Input: Google Forms, Email parser, Folder watch
* Processing: Hugging Face sentiment model, GPT-3 for summarization, Teachable Machine for image classification
* Automation: Zapier, Power Automate, IFTTT
* Output: Google Sheets, Slack, Notion, Airtable

“By the end of this step, you should have a simple system map like:
Email → GPT-3 Sentiment → Zapier → Slack + Sheets”

## 🛠️ 3. Build Time – Hands-On Lab (1 hr 45 min)

**Instructor script:**

“Now it’s time to build. I’ll guide you through the process, but you’ll be in control. Work individually or in pairs, and follow this checklist.”

**Project Build Checklist:**

✅ Step 1 – **Set Up Your Input**

* Create a Google Form or connect an email source.
* (Optional) Use a folder watcher or webhook to trigger workflows.

✅ Step 2 – **Configure the AI Processing**

* Text: Choose a Hugging Face model (e.g., sentiment, NER) or GPT-3.
* Image: Train a Teachable Machine model and export it.
* Connect your AI service to Zapier, Power Automate, or a custom workflow.

✅ Step 3 – **Add Automation Logic**

* Decide what happens next: store results, trigger a message, or update a database.
* Example: Zapier → if sentiment = negative → send Slack alert.

✅ Step 4 – **Design the Output**

* Build a results dashboard in Sheets or Airtable.
* Send emails or Slack notifications with processed insights.
* Create a downloadable report if relevant.

✅ Step 5 – **Test and Debug**

* Run through the workflow with sample data.
* Make sure every step connects smoothly.
* Adjust prompt wording, model settings, or automation triggers if needed.

---

💡 **Instructor Tips During Build:**

* Walk around and coach students on architecture decisions.
* Encourage simplicity — working end-to-end is more important than complexity.
* Push them to *name their project* and think of it like a product launch.

## 🎤 4. Presentations & Wrap-Up (1 hr)

**Instructor script:**

“Time to celebrate your first real AI product! You’ve built an end-to-end solution using tools that didn’t require a single line of code. Now, let’s present and reflect.”

**Presentation Format (5 min each):**

* **Problem:** What did you set out to solve?
* **Solution:** Show the workflow and demo the final product.
* **Tools:** What platforms and APIs did you use?
* **Lessons:** What did you learn? What would you improve?

(If you have 12 students, group presentations into pairs or triads.)

### 🌟 Closing Reflections (15 min)

**Instructor script:**

“What you’ve done today is exactly how many AI startups were building products in 2022. Most weren’t training new models — they were stitching together existing AI capabilities, connecting APIs, and automating real-world tasks.

The lesson here is profound: **you don’t need to be a data scientist to solve problems with AI.** You just need creativity, clear thinking, and the willingness to combine building blocks.”

“Finally, reflect on this question: *If this is what you can do with 2022 tools… what might be possible with 2023, 2024, or 2025 tools?*”

---

✅ **End of Module Outcomes:**
By the end of Module 6, students will have:

* Designed and deployed a functional AI solution.
* Understood the architecture behind AI-powered products.
* Experienced the complete product lifecycle — from idea to deployment.
* Gained confidence to prototype AI tools in real-world scenarios.
