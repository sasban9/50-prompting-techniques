Here’s a complete **instructor-ready script** for **Module 2 – “Automating Tasks with Low-Code AI”** of your **2022-era hands-on AI course**. It’s written so you can use it directly while teaching — it includes what to say, when to explain concepts, when to switch to demos, and what exercises students should do. The language is conversational but professional, like you’re leading a workshop.

## 🧠 Module 2 – Automating Tasks with Low-Code AI (4 hours)

**Theme:** Connecting AI to real-world workflows without writing code.
**Objective:** Learn how to use AI for automation — classifying inputs, triggering actions, and creating simple intelligent workflows.

---

### 🕐 0:00 – 0:15 | Introduction & Recap (15 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Welcome back, everyone! Yesterday we talked about what AI is and explored some basic tools. Today, we’ll take a big leap — we’ll connect AI to the real world.

Think about your email inbox. Maybe 100 messages come in every day — some are urgent, some are junk, some need replies. Imagine if AI could read each message, understand its content, and automatically decide what happens next. That’s exactly what today is about: **using AI inside automated workflows** to save time and make better decisions.

By the end of today’s session, you’ll build your first *intelligent automation system* — something that reads, understands, and acts on information without human help.”

### 🕐 0:15 – 0:45 | Understanding AI + Automation (30 min)

**Instructor Script (Concept Explanation):**
“Let’s start with a simple distinction:

* **Automation** is about doing tasks automatically — like sending an email when someone fills a form.
* **AI** is about understanding — classifying, predicting, analyzing, or generating.

When we combine them, we get something powerful: **intelligent automation**. The AI handles the ‘thinking’ part, and the automation platform handles the ‘doing’ part.

Here are some real-world examples from 2022:

* Customer support emails are automatically categorized and assigned to the right team.
* Job applications are scored and sorted without human review.
* Tweets about your brand are analyzed and trigger a Slack alert if they’re negative.

Our goal today is to replicate this kind of solution — but with zero coding.”

### 🕐 0:45 – 1:15 | Demo: Classifying Incoming Emails (30 min)

**Instructor Script (Live Demo):**
“Let’s build a simple example: an automation that reads emails, runs sentiment analysis, and labels them in a spreadsheet.”

**Step-by-step:**

1. Open **Zapier** (or **Power Automate** if you’re using Microsoft tools).
2. Choose **Gmail** as the trigger app: ‘When a new email arrives.’
3. Add an AI step using a built-in integration (e.g., **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, or **MonkeyLearn**).
4. Configure the action: send the email body to the sentiment analysis API.
5. Add a final step: store the result (subject, sender, sentiment) in a Google Sheet.

**Instructor Talking Points:**

* “Notice we didn’t write a single line of code.”
* “Our workflow now *thinks* — it reads natural language and makes a judgment.”
* “This is 80% of what businesses pay data scientists for in production systems.”

### 🕐 1:15 – 2:00 | Hands-On Lab 1: Smart Email Triage (45 min)

**Student Activity:**
Students will now build a version of the demo themselves.

**Instructions:**

1. Trigger: Gmail (new email).
2. AI step: Sentiment analysis or keyword classification.
3. Action: Add data to a spreadsheet *and* label it (e.g., “High priority” if sentiment is negative).

**Instructor Notes:**

* Walk around and help participants connect APIs if needed.
* Encourage them to experiment with different labels and categories.
* If no email access is possible, provide a dummy email feed or use a text input form.

**Debrief:**
“Congratulations — you’ve just built your first AI-powered workflow! This is how companies triage support tickets, prioritize complaints, and sort leads — all automatically.”

### 🕐 2:00 – 2:15 | Break (15 min)

---

### 🕐 2:15 – 2:45 | Understanding Workflow Design Patterns (30 min)

**Instructor Script (Whiteboard / Slide Explanation):**
“When you start designing AI automations, most workflows follow one of these patterns:

1. **Classification → Action:**

   * Example: Email sentiment → Assign to support team.
2. **Extraction → Storage:**

   * Example: Pull key info from resumes → Save in a database.
3. **Detection → Notification:**

   * Example: Detect negative tweets → Send Slack alert.
4. **Scoring → Decision:**

   * Example: Lead score → Auto-approve or reject.

Each of these is a building block. Once you understand the pattern, you can apply it to dozens of use cases.”

---

### 🕐 2:45 – 3:30 | Hands-On Lab 2: Intelligent Workflow Design (45 min)

**Student Project:**
Students will now design and build a slightly more complex automation. They can choose from one of these scenarios:

**Option A – Lead Scoring Bot:**

* Trigger: New form submission.
* AI step: Analyze message content for buying intent.
* Action: Save result and send an email if score > threshold.

**Option B – Social Listening Alert:**

* Trigger: New tweet or RSS post.
* AI step: Sentiment or keyword detection.
* Action: Slack alert if negative or urgent.

**Option C – Resume Filter:**

* Trigger: New resume uploaded.
* AI step: Extract skills + classify seniority.
* Action: Store results in Airtable for review.

**Instructor Tips:**

* Remind them to focus on the logic: Trigger → AI → Action.
* If time permits, show them how to add multiple AI steps in sequence.

---

### 🕐 3:30 – 3:50 | Showcase & Discussion (20 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Let’s pause and share what we built. Who wants to walk us through their automation?”

**Discussion Points:**

* What part was easiest?
* What part was tricky?
* Where could you use this in your real work?

This reflection reinforces learning and surfaces practical ideas.

---

### 🕐 3:50 – 4:00 | Wrap-Up & Takeaways (10 min)

**Instructor Script:**
“Today you built something that many companies still pay thousands of dollars for: an *intelligent workflow*.

Here’s what I want you to remember:

* AI isn’t just about prediction — it’s about *integration*.
* When you combine AI’s ability to understand with automation’s ability to act, you unlock real business value.
* Most useful AI products in 2022 were built exactly this way — no fancy models, just smart workflows.

In the next module, we’ll go deeper into language — using GPT-3 and NLP to make our automations even smarter.”

## 🧪 Summary of Skills Learned

By the end of Module 2, students will be able to:
✅ Explain how AI and automation complement each other
✅ Build workflows that use AI to classify, score, or extract information
✅ Connect AI decisions to real-world actions (notifications, storage, assignment)
✅ Design reusable automation patterns for different business tasks

---

💡 **Instructor Tip:** The key in 2022 is to make students realize they don’t need to build models. They just need to know how to *plug intelligence into processes* — and that mindset will serve them even as AI gets more advanced.
