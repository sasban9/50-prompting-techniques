# **Day 19: Style-Mirroring Prompts**

### Concept

Style-mirroring is about asking Gen AI to **mimic the style, tone, or voice** of a specific person, brand, or format. You can turn dry content into Shakespearean drama, make scientific explanations sound like a TikTok script, or reframe ideas in a brand‚Äôs voice. This is one of the most powerful ways to align AI with your audience‚Äôs expectations.

---

### Example 1: Shakespearean Style

**Prompt:**
‚ÄúExplain Newton‚Äôs three laws of motion in the style of Shakespeare.‚Äù

**Output (sample):**
*First law, a body shall keep its state, lest a force doth move it from fate. Second law, force be equal to mass and its haste. Third law, each push hath a push back embraced.*

---

### Example 2: Corporate Style

**Prompt:**
‚ÄúExplain Newton‚Äôs three laws of motion as if they were part of a corporate policy memo.‚Äù

**Output (sample):**
*Policy Clause 1: Objects maintain operational status until acted upon by external resources. Clause 2: Acceleration outcomes are directly proportional to applied force and inversely tied to object mass. Clause 3: For every action within the organization, an equal and opposite action will occur across stakeholders.*

### Example 3: Social Media Style

**Prompt:**
‚ÄúExplain Newton‚Äôs three laws of motion like a Gen Z TikToker.‚Äù

**Output (sample):**
*Okay besties, so basically: Law 1 = stuff stays chill unless you mess with it üíÖ. Law 2 = push harder ‚Üí it zooms faster üöÄ. Law 3 = you smack it, it smacks back üòÇ #PhysicsVibes.*

### Your Turn (Practice)

Pick a single idea or topic you know well. Examples:

* Your favorite recipe
* A productivity hack
* A recent news story
* A motivational quote

Now, prompt the AI to **explain it in three different styles**:

1. As a poet.
2. As a stand-up comedian.
3. As a serious news anchor.

Write your prompts and paste the outputs below.

---

### Reflection

* Which style felt most natural or useful for your context?
* Did any style reveal **new insights or angles** on the same content?
* How could style-mirroring improve your professional communication (emails, reports, marketing, teaching, etc.)?

Would you like me to design **all 50 days in this workbook template** (Concept ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Practice ‚Üí Reflection), so you‚Äôd have a full **ready-to-use coursebook**, or just a selection of highlight days to start with?
