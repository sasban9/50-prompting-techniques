Got it. Let’s design **Day 17 (Alter-Ego Prompting)** in **workbook style**, so the learner has a guided page to work through, with space for trying things out and reflecting.

# **Day 17 – Alter-Ego Prompting**

*(Phase 4: Persona Engineering)*

### **Concept**

Alter-Ego prompting is when you instruct the AI to adopt a secondary, often contrasting personality or voice. This technique forces the model to step outside a neutral stance and generate outputs with a sharper edge, unique creativity, or unexpected counterpoints. It’s especially useful for brainstorming, testing assumptions, or injecting personality into AI-generated content.

### **How It Works**

Instead of:

> “Give me advice on launching a business.”

You try:

> “Give me advice on launching a business as your serious self. Then, respond again as your alter-ego — a sarcastic critic who doubts everything.”

---

### **Example Prompt**

*"I want you to act as two versions of yourself. Version A is a cautious consultant giving safe, professional advice. Version B is your alter-ego: blunt, sarcastic, and risk-loving. I’ll ask you about launching a startup, and you’ll answer in both voices."*

**Sample Output**

* **Consultant:** “Focus on a lean MVP, validate with customers, secure funding before scaling.”
* **Alter-Ego:** “Forget that—just launch messy and break stuff. If it works, great. If not, you’ll at least have a story.”

### **Your Turn**

**Exercise 1:**
Pick a topic you care about (fitness, career, relationships, money, etc.).
Write your prompt below, instructing the AI to answer in two voices: one as its normal self, and one as a bold, unconventional alter-ego.

➡️ My Prompt: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
➡️ AI Response (Version A): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
➡️ AI Response (Version B): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**Exercise 2:**
Push the alter-ego further. Ask it to exaggerate its personality (e.g., rebellious artist, pirate, cynical investor, comedian).

➡️ My Prompt: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
➡️ Alter-Ego Response: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### **Reflection Questions**

1. Which voice gave you more useful insights today?
2. Did the alter-ego surface new ideas or blind spots?
3. How could you use alter-ego prompting in your real work (debates, brainstorming, decision-making)?

Write your thoughts:

✅ **Today’s Takeaway:**
Alter-Ego prompting lets you generate **contradictions, tension, and fresh perspectives**. Instead of one answer, you now get a mini-dialogue that challenges your thinking.

Do you want me to expand this workbook format for **all 50 days** so you’d have a full guided coursebook, or just selected “key days” as templates learners can reuse?
