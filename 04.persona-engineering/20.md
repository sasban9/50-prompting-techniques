# **Day 20: Role Conflict Prompting**

*Workbook Style*

### **Concept**

Role conflict prompting means assigning the AI **two or more contradictory roles** and asking it to respond while holding those tensions at once. This often produces rich, nuanced outputs, since the AI is forced to ‚Äúargue with itself‚Äù or balance competing priorities.

Why it works:

* It pushes the AI beyond a single perspective.
* It generates internal dialogue, showing trade-offs.
* It simulates real-world debates or conflicts of interest.

---

### **Guided Example**

**Prompt:**
‚ÄúYou are both a CEO of a large corporation and a labor union leader. Discuss whether employees should return to office full-time.‚Äù

**Sample Output (shortened):**

* **CEO voice:** ‚ÄúFull-time office work strengthens culture, collaboration, and productivity.‚Äù
* **Union leader voice:** ‚ÄúEmployees need flexibility for work-life balance and health. Mandatory office policies erode trust.‚Äù
* **Conflict synthesis:** ‚ÄúPerhaps a hybrid compromise allows culture-building without sacrificing autonomy.‚Äù

Notice how the contradiction generates a more layered outcome than asking just one role.

### **Your Turn ‚Äì Practice Exercise**

Try it yourself. Copy the structure below into your AI tool and see what happens.

**Practice Prompt:**
‚ÄúYou are both a strict school principal who believes in discipline, and a student activist fighting for freedom of expression. Debate whether mobile phones should be allowed in classrooms.‚Äù

üëâ Write down:

1. What arguments came from the principal side?
2. What arguments came from the activist side?
3. Did the AI find a middle ground or lean to one side?

---

### **Stretch Challenge**

Level it up by adding a **third conflicting role**. For example:
‚ÄúYou are a government policy maker, a tech company founder, and a privacy activist. Argue about the use of facial recognition in public spaces.‚Äù

---

### **Reflection Journal**

* How does role conflict prompting change the **depth** of the AI‚Äôs answer?
* Did you notice any surprising compromises or insights?
* In your field (business, art, teaching, research), what roles could you set in conflict to generate powerful new perspectives?
